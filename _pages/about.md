Hi there! My name is Joel. I'm a Catalan Ph.D. Student at the University of Toronto (Major in Comparative Politics, Minor in International Relations). My thesis explores to what extent masculinity is a relevant dimension to conceptualize political behavior in a comparative perspective across sexuality, gender, class and race. Broadly, my interests revolve around the determinants, barriers and backlash against LGBTIQ+ rights, the determinants of European Union redistribution policies and public support, and materialist vs. ideationalist explanations in political behavior in Europe and North America.
